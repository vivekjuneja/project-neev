# project-neev
Project Neev is the outline for building Agile Infrastructure that delivers! 

It covers the following agenda :-

1. Overall objectives of Agile Infrastructure
2. Tools and Technologies
3. Overall System Design
4. Proof of Concept solutions
5. Reference implementation
6. Examples
7. Agile Infrastructure needs Mindset


**Design Goals** :-

1. Allow Quick Build, Deploy and Release process for Software
2. Should be as much as possible Infrastructure Agnostic
3. Should support different Software Architecture styles - Monoliths, Microservices, Multi-Apps, Event Driven etc.
4. Provide quick and updated feedback to all participants on all aspects of the Software lifecycle 
5. Must be easy to get started for new teams
6. Strongly configurable to allow features to be added or removed on demand
7. Must not be strongly coupled with a choice of implementation technology
8. Driven by Horizontal-Scaling-First and Independent-Service-Teams-First

**Feature Backlog** :-

1. Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline
2. Use Machine Images for Deployment, rather than Code artifact
3. Support variety of infrastructure - AWS, OpenStack, BareMetal etc.
4. Provide standardized Developer Project Templates
5. Provide provisioning capability for standard infrastructure - Databases, Messaging, Queue, Caching on demand
6. Fast Validation of Inconsistencies and Non-compliance of Release
7. Consistent Environments across Production, Dev, and Test using common Provisioning and Declarative manifests
8. Integrated Metrics Collection and Monitoring for each Project
9. Integrated Log collection, search and visualization for each Project
10. Support Canary Release / Rolling upgrades
11. API Integration for adding new toolchain or features in the Platform
12. Integration support for adding new toolchain or features in the Platform
13. Setup SLAs on each Project and allow for constant monitoring
14. Provide Notification for different Platform events - Release, Deploy, Build, SLA, Failure events etc.
15. Allows to declare and version the Infrastructure topology for each Project
16. Allows for declarative Scaling to maintain consistent SLAs for each Project
17. Visualize and Search dependencies for each Project
18. Support 12 Factor Application methods and Techniques
19. Allow new Governance and Compliance policies to be added on Demand
